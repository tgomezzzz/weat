### Motivation
The Covid-19 pandemic has been disastrous for the restaurant industry. Many restaurants have closed permanently, and the ones that remain open struggle to make a profit from takeout and restricted dining capacities. Weat aims to connect diners back with the restaurants they love by providing simple meal and grocery subscriptions, straight from the restaurants users frequent.
